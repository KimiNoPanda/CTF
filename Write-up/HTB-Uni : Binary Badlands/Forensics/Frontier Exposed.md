# Frontier Exposed
- **Category:** Forensics
- **Difficulty:** Very Easy
- **Description:** "The chaos within the Frontier Cluster is relentless, with malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities to establish footholds across the expanse. During routine surveillance, an open directory vulnerability was identified on a web server, suggesting suspicious activities tied to the Frontier Board. Your mission is to thoroughly investigate the server and determine a strategy to dismantle their infrastructure. Any credentials uncovered during the investigation would prove invaluable in achieving this objective. Spawn the docker and start the investigation!"

By opening each file, we can see in the `.bash_history` :

```bash
nmap -sC -sV nmap_scan_results.txt jackcolt.dev

We can see the use of a password and copying it into cyberchef gives us the flag : HTB{C2_cr3d3nt14ls_3xp0s3d}
